# OTIS APRO (Acceptance Protocol) Application - Version 0.1

## Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript application that digitizes the OTIS elevator acceptance protocol process. The system guides users through a step-by-step questionnaire, allows error documentation with images, generates PDFs, and enables sharing via email or cloud storage. It supports both Hungarian and German languages.

**Current Version**: OTIS APRO 0.1 - Stable Release (January 27, 2025)
**Status**: Production Ready ✅

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language (Hungarian preferred).

## Recent Changes

### January 26, 2025 - UI Stability Improvements
- **Text Input Stabilization**: ✅ COMPLETED - MegaStableInput component with 1.5-second debouncing eliminates cursor jumping and UI flickering during text entry
- **Radio Button Issue**: ❌ ONGOING PROBLEM - Radio button selection still causes page navigation despite multiple attempts with UltraStableRadio, InstantRadio components
- **Excel Question Loading**: ✅ COMPLETED - Questions now load from uploaded Excel files (9 questions loading successfully)
- **Admin File Management**: ✅ COMPLETED - Template deletion functionality with physical file removal working properly
- **Database Integration**: ✅ COMPLETED - Full PostgreSQL integration with Neon serverless configuration
- **Component Architecture**: ✅ COMPLETED - Isolated question components with full memoization

### Current Issues (January 27, 2025)
- **Radio Button Page Switching**: CRITICAL UNRESOLVED - Radio button selections trigger unwanted page navigation. Attempted solutions:
  - UltraStableRadio with 800ms debounce
  - InstantRadio with immediate response 
  - IsolatedRadio with complete event isolation
  - ZeroRadio with minimal logic
  - SimpleRadio with no fancy features
  - Multiple useEffect dependency changes
  - Complete event propagation prevention methods
  - Focus/blur handling improvements
  - Removing language dependency from useEffect
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Component remounting causing continuous API calls and state resets

### Analysis
- Questions still reload multiple times ("Loaded questions from API (ONCE)" appears 3x)
- Component is remounting repeatedly, not just re-rendering
- Problem is architectural, not with radio button components
- Need to investigate App.tsx state management and parent re-renders

### Latest Attempts (January 27, 2025)
- **StableQuestionnaire**: Created completely new component with useRef for local state storage
- **Debounced Updates**: 100ms delay between local updates and parent notifications  
- **Direct HTML Radio**: Replaced complex radio components with simple HTML inputs
- **CacheRadio**: Global Map cache + zero parent updates until Save button
- **CacheInput**: Text/number input cache preventing UI refreshes during typing
- **Logo Fix**: ✅ COMPLETED - Moved logo to client/public/ for proper static serving, increased size (start: h-48 w-48, header: h-12 w-12)
- **Component Isolation**: Multiple attempts to isolate radio state from parent updates

- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Development/production mode detection
