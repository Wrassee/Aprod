You have just completed a major refactoring of this project based on my previous instructions. Now, I need you to perform a final verification checklist to ensure everything is working correctly on the local development environment before we proceed.

Please execute the following tests and report the success or failure of each step.

### **Final Verification Checklist**

**1. Build Test:**
- **Action:** Run the command: `npm run build`
- **Expected Result:** The command must complete without any errors. A `dist` directory should be created.
- **Please confirm:** Was the build successful?

**2. Local Development Server Test:**
- **Action:** Run the command: `npm run dev`
- **Expected Result:** The server must start without any errors. The terminal should display a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
- **Please confirm:** Did the dev server start successfully? What URL is it running on?

**3. Functional Tests (while the dev server is running):**

**3.1. Visual Appearance:**
- **Action:** Simulate opening the application at the localhost URL provided above.
- **Expected Result:** The start page should render correctly with full styling. The layout should be visually correct, not just plain, unstyled text.
- **Please confirm:** Does the page load with CSS applied correctly?

**3.2. Static Asset Loading:**
- **Action:** Observe the fully rendered start page.
- **Expected Result:** The `otis-logo.png` image should be visible. There should be NO 404 errors in the browser console for any images (`.png`) or the manifest icons.
- **Please confirm:** Are the logo and PWA icons loading correctly without 404 errors?

**3.3. API Functionality (Backend Routing):**
- **Action:** Simulate navigating to the "Admin" page of the application.
- **Expected Result:** This action should trigger a `GET` request to the `/api/admin/templates` endpoint. This request must succeed and return a response (even if it's an empty array `[]`). It must NOT return a 500 Internal Server Error or a 404 Not Found error.
- **Please confirm:** Does the `GET /api/admin/templates` API call work correctly?

**3.4. File Upload on Localhost:**
- **Action:** Simulate uploading a file on the "Admin" page.
- **Expected Result:** The file upload should be handled successfully by the backend. Because the environment is `development`, the code should save the temporary file to the local `./uploads` directory.
- **Please confirm:** Does the file upload logic work correctly in the local environment?
